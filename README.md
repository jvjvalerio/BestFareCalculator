# Best Fare Calculator
A Best Fare Calculator for New York City!

Project Goals:
If you’ve ever wondered if you chose the right fare option for riding the metro or bus, you’re not alone. In this project we will write a Java program that determines the best fare option for someone visiting New York City who plans to use the NYC transit system. The program will use constructors, methods, conditionals, loops, and arrays.
